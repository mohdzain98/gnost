GNOST helps developers understand unfamiliar codebases by automatically identifying entry points, execution flow, and core logic. It is designed for first-day onboarding, not just code statistics.

## Why GNOST?
- Quickly build a mental model of a new codebase
- See how execution flows without reading everything
- Generate onboarding docs and Mermaid diagrams with one command

## What GNOST Does
- Detects **where execution starts**
- Infers **high-level execution flow**
- Identifies **hotspot files** (most important code)
- Generates **onboarding documentation**
- Produces **Mermaid flow diagrams**
- Works across multiple languages

## Getting Started
Install:

```bash
pip install gnost
```

Run the onboarding scan:

```bash
gnost onboard .
```

Minimal usage examples:

```bash
gnost summary .
gnost stats .
```

Supported languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java.
